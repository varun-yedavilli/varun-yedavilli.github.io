### CPSC 120

* Lab 4, Part 2

    I enjoyed doing Lab 4, Part 2 because it produced the game of HiLo. I have
    coded this game in python and java before, and it is one of my favorite
    things to code. It is a fun game and it requires some knowledge of the
    coding language while also not requiring massive amounts of knowledge.
    Coding this game helps learn a language really well.

* Lab 6, Part 2

    Lab 6, Part 2's task was to code a blackjack cardchecker. Blackjack is one
    of my favorite games to play because it was the first card game I learned.
    This lab was slightly challenging because of all the requirements to count
    the points of the cards, but it was gratifying when finished. This card
    point counter is also very useful for someone learning the game and rules.

* Lab 9, Part 2

    Lab 9, Part 2's task is to check whether a schedule to two philisophers
    would never overlap. I thought that this scenario was funny because two
    philosophers would neve be able to stop talking if the started, so they are
    kept away from each other. The actual process for coding was fun because it
    was easy to setup and understand the goal of the project. This project felt
    like a fun challenge.
